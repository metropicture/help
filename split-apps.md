# Split apps

Metropicture supports two gestures crucial for splitting apps so that you can see them side by side.

1. Pinch top and drag bottom indefinitely
2. Drag and release the app to one of the top, bottom, center, left and right locations.

Notice the following:

- Releasing the app in the center cancels the split.
- Releasing the app to top or bottom will keep the app at one of the vertical sides and display a draggable app separator.
- Releasing the app to left or right will keep the app at one of the horizontal sides and display a draggable app separator.
