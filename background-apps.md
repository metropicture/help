# Background apps

There are two gestures crucial for displaying apps that are out of your screen:

1. Click or drag the previous background app

2. Move to the bottom left corner, then slide up shortly for left bar containing all apps as items that you may click or drag. Or do the reverse: move to the upper left corner, then slide bottom shortly.

- When clicking an app item, the app will fully expand and the current app grid will move to background.
- When dragging an app item, it may be released in one of the left, center and right locations, creating or contributing to a horizontal split.

Releasing an app item to the center will fully expand the app and move the current app grid to the background.
