There are two gestures crucial for resuming or dragging apps that are out of your screen:

- Click or drag background app

- Move to the bottom left corner, then slide up shortly for left bar containing all apps as items that you may click or drag.

When clicking an app as an item, the app will show in the entire screen and any other apps will move to background.

When dragging an app as an item, it may be released in one of the top, bottom, center, left, and right locations, creating or contributing to a split.
