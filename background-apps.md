It is alternatively allowed to show up the left bar from the upper left corner (the reverse).

- When clicking an app as an item, the app will show in the entire screen and any other apps will move to background.
- When dragging an app as an item, it may be released in one of the left, center and right locations, creating or contributing to a horizontal split.
