# Background apps

There are two gestures crucial for resuming or dragging apps that are out of your screen:

- Slide to the upper left corner, then slide to upper right until a short segment: this shows the app as an item in the upper left corner that you may click or drag.
- Slide to the bottom left corner, then slide to the top until short or infinite segment; this shows a left bar containing all apps as items that you may click or drag.
