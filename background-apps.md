# Background apps

There are two gestures crucial for resuming or dragging apps that are out of your screen:

- Move to the upper left corner, then slide out until a tiny segment: this shows the app as an item in the upper left corner that you may click or drag.
- Move to the bottom left corner, then slide to the top until a tiny segment; this shows a left bar containing all apps as items that you may click or drag.

When clicking an app as an item, the app will show in the entire screen and any other apps will move to background.

When dragging an app as an item, it may be released in one of the top, bottom, center, left, and right locations, performing a split.
