# Presentation

Metropicture is an open source Unix based operating system for desktop operating systems.

For maximum compatibility with existing apps, Metropicture is based in the Debian operating system.

## Big picture or desktop

The operating system defaults to a big picture mode that allows displaying apps side by side horizontally through dynamic divisors; the user may switch between big picture and desktop. However, the user can choose to prefer the desktop mode by default and a *desktop* start menu through the system settings.

In the desktop mode, windows are priorized over big picture windows when opening apps.

## Status or right menu

Moving to the bottom right corner and sliding up shows up the status (date and time, battery icon and connectivity icon) and then expands to displaying the right menu.

## File Explorer app

The File Explorer app browses files in the local machine, in the user home, in removable devices, and in networks.
